Cruiser was a one-year-old golden retriever, and he was more than excited to meet the humans of his new family. He dreamed that they sat on furniture made of peanut butter and brand new tennis balls. It was finally Wednesday, the day he was scheduled to be picked up. 

All of a sudden, 2 large humans and 1 smaller human entered the room and started talking to Cruiser in a weird strange language. They attached a leash to his collar and took him outside for a walk. He had a great time playing with the small human who seemed much more excited than the 2 larger ones about meeting him.

On the way back home Cruiser saw a Squirrel he had to have. He ran after the squirrel with all his might pulling his human right into the bushes, but the squirrel had made its way up the giant version of his favorite fetch toy. He wonders why all the squirrels run from him when all he wants is to play.

Cruiser heard the smaller human call him and he speedily bolted over to see what she was holding. He couldn't believe his excitement once he realized he was given a stuffed friend. Cruiser decided he would name his stuffed friend Andrew. He gazed up at the smaller human and the two larger humans and wagged his tail the fastest he's ever wagged.
