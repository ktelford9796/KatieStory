Cruiser was a one-year-old golden retriever, and he was more than excited to meet the humans of his new family. He dreamed that they sat on furniture made of peanut butter and brand new tennis balls. It was finally Wednesday, the day he was scheduled to be picked up. 

All of a sudden, 2 large humans and 1 smaller human entered the room and started talking to Cruiser in a weird strange language. They attached a leash to his collar and took him outside for a walk. He had a great time playing with the small human who seemed much more excited than the 2 larger ones about meeting him.
